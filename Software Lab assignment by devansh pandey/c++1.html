  <h2 class="htmlhead">WHAT IS C++?</h2> <br>
  <p class="htmltxt">C++ is a middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs. C++ runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. This C++ tutorial adopts a simple and practical approach to describe the concepts of C++ for beginners to advanded software engineers. <br> <br>

    
C++ is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning C++:
<br> <br>
C++ is very close to hardware, so you get a chance to work at a low level which gives you lot of control in terms of memory management, better performance and finally a robust software development. <br> <br>

C++ programming gives you a clear understanding about Object Oriented Programming. You will understand low level implementation of polymorphism when you will implement virtual tables and virtual table pointers, or dynamic type identification. <br> <br>

C++ is one of the every green programming languages and loved by millions of software developers. If you are a great C++ programmer then you will never sit without work and more importantly you will get highly paid for your work.<br> <br>

C++ is the most widely used programming languages in application and system programming. So you can choose your area of interest of software development.<br> <br>

C++ really teaches you the difference between compiler, linker and loader, different data types, storage classes, variable types their scopes etc.<br> <br>

There are 1000s of good reasons to learn C++ Programming. But one thing for sure, to learn any programming language, not only C++, you just need to code, and code and finally code until you become expert.<bsr> <br>
